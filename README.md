- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ivan Bykov aka @Mookker
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and software architecture. But outside this I like to play and watch football. Also, I'm interested in cars and everything related.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning new technologies and tools, and this repository is playground for me
- Code here is obviously not production ready, and shouldn't be used as it's, but you can watch how different things can be done.
